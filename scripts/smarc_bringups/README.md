# SMaRC Bringups

A pile of launch files and bash scripts.

> Example use: `ros2 run smarc_bringups sam_bringup.sh`

The general structure and naming of launchfiles should resemble the folder structure of the `smarc2` repository.

## Scripts
This is where the bringup bash scripts live.
We use `tmux` to create tabs and launch things in, for all the reasons `tmux` is good for.

In general, these bash scripts should take minimal number of arguments, if any.
If a large number of args are needed, maybe use a `config.yaml` filename to pass as an arg instead.

### sam_bringup.sh

Launches everything related to SAM. Add the following lines to your .bashrc and restart your terminal. 

```bash
export LOCAL_ROBOT_NAME=<your sam name>

# Local MQTT Broker with mosquitto
export LOCAL_MQTT_BROKER_IP=<your local ip>
export LOCAL_MQTT_BROKER_PORT=<your local port>

# WARA-PS MQTT Broker
#export LOCAL_MQTT_BROKER_IP=20.240.40.232·
#export LOCAL_MQTT_BROKER_PORT=1884
```
This allows us to change the bringup as we see fit without having to worry
about individual setups regarding MQTT and the robot name. If you want to use
the WARA-PS MQTT Broker instead, use uncomment the last two lines instead.

In the beginning of the script, you can set whether you're on SAM or not.

### dji_bringup.sh

Launches everything related to DJI drones and the ALARS project.
**You will need the submodule in `messages/psdk_interfaces` to run the captain this bringup launches.**

#### Camera udev rules
Since we have multiple cams, of different kinds, we have udev rules setup in the jetson to give them fixed device symlinks under `ls /dev`:
Example:
```
> lsusb
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0bda:0420 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0bda:5420 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. 4-Port USB 2.0 Hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0032 Intel Corp. AX210 Bluetooth
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 2ca3:0023 DJI Technology Co., Ltd. DJIPocket3
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundat

> v4l2-ctl --list-devices
HD Pro Webcam C920 (usb-0000:00:14.0-3): 
    /dev/video0

Logitech Webcam C270 (usb-0000:00:14.0-4): 
    /dev/video1



> sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/80-djipocket3.rules

# DJIPocket3 (vendor 2ca3, product 0023)
# Video streaming node (usually index 0)
SUBSYSTEM=="video4linux", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2ca3", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0023", ATTR{index}=="0", SYMLINK+="djipocket3"
# Secondary node (often metadata/still capture; usually index 1)
SUBSYSTEM=="video4linux", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2ca3", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0023", ATTR{index}=="1", SYMLINK+="djipocket3_meta"
# Media controller node
SUBSYSTEM=="media",       ATTRS{idVendor}=="2ca3", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0023", SYMLINK+="djipocket3_media"
```
The above makes `/dev/djipocket3` point to the video stream of the cam, independently of connection timing/port/other cams etc.


## TMUX Cheatsheet
- `C-x` means "press control and `x`" at the same time. If its `C-X`, then its "Control Shift x".
- `C-b, d` means "Control+B, release everything, d".
- List sessions: `tmux ls`
- Attach to a session: `tmux attach -t <SESSION_NAME>`. Can be shortened to `tmux att -t sam` for example for a session named `sam0_bringup`
- Detach from a session: `C-b, d`
- Change between windows(tabs): `C-b, <NUM>`
- Scroll in a window: `C-b [` and then arrows/pg up etc. `q` to quit scroll mode.
- Kill tmux server (and all the programs running in all sessions): `tmux kill-server`. This is the ultimate "cleanup". Beware of using this on the real robot!
